## How to use Hscript Support.
A script is a collection of functions that are called at various points during gameplay. The engine provides several hooks that modders can use to insert custom behavior into the game. The following hooks are currently available:

- `onCreate()`: Called when the gameplay state is created.
- `createPost()`: Called after the gameplay state is created.
- `update(elapsed:Float)`: Called every frame before the gameplay state is updated.
- `updatePost(elapsed:Float)`: Called every frame after the gameplay state is updated.
- `beatHit()`: Called when a beat is hit.
- `stepHit()`: Called when a step is hit.
- `goodNoteHit(note:Note)`: Called when a note is hit correctly.
- `noteTooLate(daNote:Note)`: Called when a note is missed because it was hit too late.
- `noteMiss(direction:Int)`: Called when a note is missed because it was not hit.

To add custom behavior to the game, modders can write their own functions and add them to the script. For example:
```hx
var sprite:FlxSprite;

function onCreate(){
    trace("State created.");

    sprite = new FlxSprite(0, 0);
    sprite.loadGraphic(ModAssets.getGraphic("images/test.png", curMod)); // or you can do `ModAssets.getGraphic("images/test.png", null, "ModIDHere");` to get a graphic within another Mod.
    add(sprite);
}

function update(elapsed){
    // Custom update behavior.
}

function updatePost(elapsed){
    // Custom post update behavior.
}
```

If a function doesn't need any parameters, it needs to be defined without any.

### Accessing Haxe and Flixel Classes and Functions.

- `FlxWaveMode`: Wave mode class.

Functions:
- `add(value:FlxObject)`: Adds a FlxObject to the scene.
- `setDefaultZoom(value:Float)`: Sets the default camera zoom.
- `setGF(value:String)`: Sets the current Girlfriend.
- `curGF()`: Returns the current Girlfriend.
- `createTrail(char:FlxObject, graphic:FlxGraphic, length:Int, delay:Float, alpha:Float, diff:Float, ?addInGroup:Bool, ?group:FlxGroup)`: Creates a trail effect.
- `replaceStrum(style:String, ?skipTransition:Bool, ?dontGenCPU:Bool)`: Replace all strumlines with given data, Generates with no Preferences attatched.

Objects:
- `camHUD`: The HUD Camera.
- `camGame`: The Game Camera.
- `playerStrums`: Player Strums.
- `cpuStrums`: CPU Strums.

Groups:
- `strumLines`: All Strums.
- `stageLayer0`: Layer 0 of the stage - Behind all.
- `stageLayer1`: Layer 1 of the stage - Above GF.
- `stageLayer2`: Layer 2 of the stage - Above All.
- `boyfriendGroup`: The group of BF's.
- `dadGroup`: The group of Dad's.
- `gfGroup`: The group of GF's.

Characters:
- `boyfriend`: The `Boyfriend` character.
- `dad`: The `Dad` character.
- `gf`: The `GF` character.

Shaders:
- `BuildingShaders`: Building shader class.
- `ColorSwap`: Color swap shader class.

Misc:
- `curMod`: The current mod ID loaded.
- `SONG`: The current song data.
- `curSong`: The current song name.
- `curStage`: The current stage name.

- `inCutscene`: Whether or not the game is in a cutscene.
- `curBeat`: The current beat number.
- `curStep`: The current step number.

### What it's used for, and Advice.
Currently, Hscript is used for making Stages and for any purpose you have in-song. You put scripts in `data/stages` or in `data/charts/SONG_NAME`.

For stages you have to name your script `script.hx` or it will not be detected, all scripts within your songs folder will be detected automatically.

I would recommend reading the code in `source/game/PlayState.hx`, `source/engine/modutil/Hscript.hx`, `source/engine/modding/SpunModLib.hx`, and the code for the variables you have access to for more information.
