## Licenses
If you haven't noticed, there are 2 Licenses in this Repo. I'm not sure if this is allowed so if it isn't ignore everything except the Apache 2.0 License, especially if the other License(s) are not legally binding, I would consult with a legal professional but I'm pretty sure that requires money.

But if everything is good, the [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/SpunBlue/FNF-Blueberry-Engine/blob/main/LICENSE) License is used for all assets, source code, etc., Except for everything located in [source/engine/modding](https://github.com/SpunBlue/FNF-Blueberry-Engine/blob/main/source/engine/modding) which is all under the [DSMS](https://github.com/SpunBlue/FNF-Blueberry-Engine/blob/main/source/engine/modding/LICENSE) License.

Q & A:

Q: Why did you do this?
:-
A: I'm too proud of my Modding Script(s) and I wanted it to be under a seperate license.

Q: Is everything in [modutil](https://github.com/SpunBlue/FNF-Blueberry-Engine/tree/main/source/engine/modutil) under the DSMS License?
:-
A: No, It's not. Only the stuff located in [source/engine/modding](https://github.com/SpunBlue/FNF-Blueberry-Engine/blob/main/source/engine/modding) is under that License.

Q: What will you do if the DSMS License Isn't legally binding or if you can't have multiple licenses?
:-
A: I will remove the Script(s) under that license and put in another Repo with the appropriate License, I will of course have a Batch Script that will automatically download and Import the correct version of those Script(s) into the proper directories for Modders modifiying the Engine.

Q: I hate the DSMS License!!
:-
A: Not really a question, but I completely understand. If it (or my other plan) gets too much backlash, I will put it under the Apache 2.0 License like everything else.
